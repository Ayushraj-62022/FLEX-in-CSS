The flexible box layout module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer 
space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox
 which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.

When we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as
 a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.

 Properties of flexbox:

Parent properties:

display defines a flex container – flex formatting context.
flex-direction defines the main axis inside the container.
flex-wrap allows flex items to wrap onto more than one line.
flex-flow shorthand for flex-direction + flex-wrap.
justify-content allows items to align along main axis.
align-content allows items to align along cross axis in a single line.
align-items aligns multiple lines of items on the cross axis.
Children/Flex-items properties:

order allows the change of order of items without altering the source order.
flex-grow allows an item to fill up the available free space.
flex-shrink allows an item to shrink if there is no enough free space available.
flex-basis defines the size of an item before space is distributed.
flex is the shorthand for flex-grow + flex-shrink + flex-basis.
flex-self has the ability to align one single item within the flex container.
